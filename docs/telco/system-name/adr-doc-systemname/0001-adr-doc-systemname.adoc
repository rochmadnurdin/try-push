* Status: [proposed | rejected | accepted | superseded by <<0002-adr-doc-new-decision-systemname.adoc#, ADR 0002 New Decision>>
* Deciders: [list everyone involved in the decision]
* Date: [YYYY-MM-DD when the decision was last updated]

=== Consequences

Good or bad implications because the decisions. For example: The system must follow implementation reference in the bottom of this document.
